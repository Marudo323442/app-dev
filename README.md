# **Super Aleste**
---
> Super Aleste is a shoot 'em up *(often shortened to shmups)* made by **Compile** with main designer credited to **Takayuki Hirono** and published by *Toho* released in *April 8, 1992* for the **Super Famicom** and was then localized to the **Super Nintendo Entertainment System** as **Space Megaforce** in *October of 1992*.
> This is a game that has succeeded particularly in providing a shoot 'em up that runs in full speed with minimal slowdown whilst showcasing the Super Famicom's full graphical capability.
> Shooters on the Super Famicom are often known to slowdown during the action due to the abundance of bullets on screen and the sprite limit causing flickering so this was a genuine marvel at the time.
> Its gameplay also features a number of things that is unique to it as a shooter those being:
> -Slow Scrolling but with fast and unrelenting enemies and obstacles, both typical and atypical of Compile's previous works.
> -No level collission to account for the dense enemies and level design.
> -Tons of sprite scaling, including entire levels scaling and rotating all around to enhance the feeling of flight.
> -A fairly indepth continue system wherein other arcade shooters on the system reverted you back at the start whenever you gameover; Super Aleste meanwhile provides you with several options whether to go back to a checkpoint, restart the entire level, or choose to gameover to headback into the title screen where it also lets you choose between restarting the game or continuing back at the last level you played, this offered way more options than what most other games (not just arcade shooters) provides including button remapping, another rarity during the 16-bit era of gaming.
> Super Aleste is Also part of the Aleste series which started out as the zanac series on the msx before Compile ran into trademarking problems and renamed the series to aleste and continued on the msx2 with aleste.
> Compile had a long history with the Aleste series which mostly stayed in the msx2 computer system and the sega consoles from the sega master system, sega game gear, then sega genesis/megadrive + sega/mega cd.
> But Super Aleste wasn't the first game in the series that deviated over to Nintendo as the series' predecessor had a port of Zanac over at the Nintendo Entertainment System, and the parody spinoff of aleste called Gun-Nac.
> With Super Aleste however provided the most unique game in the series with both its slower pace but more dense gameplay, indepth continue options, and a newly different and slower paced soundtrack to accomodate the slower scrolling speed but still maintained the same density as previous games.
> The music in particular I like as it goes for a more jazzy soundtrack to go along with the gameplay and it's a great soundtrack done by these three (3) composers:
> 1. Keiji Takeuchi
> 2. Akiyoshi "Einosuke" Nagao
> 3. Katsumi Tanaka
